At present the recent wokwi repository is used,
as a base for newly created repositories (to
retain a significantly older Initial commit
across multiple repositories - for new work).

 git reset --hard
 git gc

These two are primarily used to limit the extent of
old (unwanted) stuff from that repository.

 du -ka

This is used to check for significant reductions in
storage (don't really care if unused resources are
not purged - not a security issue at all).
